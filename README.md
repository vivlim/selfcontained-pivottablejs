# self-contained pivottable.js

(work in progress)

the goal of this project is to build a single html file that contains all of the dependencies of [PivotTable.js](https://pivottable.js.org)

## license?
it's currently not licensed because i'm still actively working on it, and need to think more about which license to use. i also need to consider the licenses of the dependencies & how to surface those in the resulting html file, because *that* is a distribution
